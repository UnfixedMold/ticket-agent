      "Sooo I just noticed a $19.99 charge from you guys on June 09 through PayPal and I'm kinda confused? I think it might be for some extended warranty thing but honestly I don't remember signing up for that. This may be my fault but I just need someone to walk me through it slowly. Can you check if this was supposed to happen or if I got charged by accident? Thanks!\n",

Could you please check what's going on with the delivery? If it's not coming soon, I'd like to return it and get a refund. Thanks so much for your help!\n",
